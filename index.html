               <h2>Sabaton</h2>
               <p>Sabaton is the band that started my journey into power metal, though Sabaton doesn't call themself that; it's hard to define a subgenre for them as they are really their own style. As someone into military history I instantly fell in love with their theme of writing songs about historic battles and heroism. Sabaton tries to not glorify war, but instead seeks to help us remember the lessons history has taught us, honor the fallen and praise acts of heroism and selflessness on the field. 
                  With extremely catchy anthemic choruses and a bit of "pop" like sound, they're one of my favorite bands to sing along with on a long drive. They also put on one of the best live shows I've ever seen. The lead singer Joakim Brode&#769;n has fantastic stage energy and it's hard not to get pumped up when he hypes the crowd! Sabaton is from Falun, Sweden and is very popular in the part of the world but are well known world wide in the metal community.

               <h2>GWAR</h2>
               <p>Next on our list we have a very unique metal group. Formed in Richmond, Virgina in 1984, GWAR has been on the scene for as long as I've been on this planet! GWAR is unique in that they are not a static group of musicians but instead a rotating line-up of musicians, artists and filmmakers collectively known as Slave Pit Inc. that operates out of the VCU School of Arts. GWAR is well known for their on stage antics, dressing up in comical costumes, using large set pieces for skits, and spraying
                  the crowd with fake blood during their stage shows. As a result of these antics GWAR has been the subject of controversy, but their act is rooted in satire and humor. Live shows are definitely a one of a kind experience.

               <h2>Dance With The Dead</h2>
               <p>Next up is a band that isn't metal, but the artist duo has their metal roots making their start in 2 seperate metal bands. Hailing out of Orange County, California, this duo makes electronic music known as synthwave. It's a style of music that pays tribute to things like retro sci-fi, horror and video games. Dance With The Dead finds most of their inspiration from 80's John Carpenter horror films. With vibrant and energetic beats and synth combined with killer guitar riffs and drums, these guys 
                  can make a synthwave fan out of most metal listeners.

               <h2>Haken</h2>
               <p>Haken is a progressive band from London, England that straddles the line between rock and metal. Their albums are heavily conceptual, and my favorite is Vector which is very close to a rock opera. The album follows a catatonic patient whose mind is sparked by the treatment he's being given. The concepts explored throughout Haken's discography are often abstract and thought provoking. With this along with catchy and unique musical hooks as well as a very interesting musical style, I find the music
                  of this band to be best explored full albums at a time. Sadly I had planned to go to a show with Haken in the lineup, but the show date was in March of 2020 and the pandemic put that to an end. Hopefully after the pandemic ends they'll make plans to come to the US again soon.

               <h2>Devin Townsend</h2>
               <p>To be honest, I'm not really sure where to start with Devin Townsend. A common joke among his fans is that when asked what musical genre he is, you respond "Devin Townsend is Devin Townsend". But I suppose a good place to start would be that he began in the extreme metal band Strapping Young Lad in 1994 out of Vancouver, Canada. After leaving SYL in 2007 he has since had an extensive solo career spanning 25 albums across multiple projects. These projects cross the line between many categories including
                  heavy metal, extreme metal, progressive metal, stoner metal, electronic music and more. Devin Townsend has been compared to the likes of Frank Zappa with his odd, eccentric and unique styles and his lyrical style is found in expressing his personality.

               <h2>Animals as Leaders</h2>
               <p>Animals as Leaders is a progressive metal band out of Washington, D.C. A fitting band name, Animals as Leaders is a prominent leader on the djent scene, bringing fresh and experimental tracks merging the heavy riffs of djent and the harmonous dischord of modern jazz. This trio has a very unique setup as they have two guitar players and one drummer, but also use their 7 and 8 string guitars as bass using tone shifters. The result is something very unique and fantastic. I cannot stress enough how 
                  impressive their talent is in delivering heavily technical tunes, utilizing non-standard time signatures and changes as well as asyncronous rythym. The band is purely instrumental which makes it that much easier to fall in love with the technical prowess displayed on the instruments, but if you must have a good song to accompany the instruments they intend to release an upcoming album with guest singers soon.
